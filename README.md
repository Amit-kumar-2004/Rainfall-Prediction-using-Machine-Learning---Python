# Rainfall-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning---Python
Machine learning improves rainfall prediction by analyzing atmospheric data. Using Python libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and XGBoost, models process historical weather patterns to enhance accuracy. Key steps include data preprocessing, feature selection, training models, and evaluation to predict whether it will rain today.
